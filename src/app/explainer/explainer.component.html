<h2>What you need to build</h2>

<p>
  Using the API documented
  <a href="https://www.boredapi.com/documentation" target="noopener"
    >at this link</a
  >
  build an application that displays random activities for the day.
</p>

<p>You can use any library you want for this task.</p>

<p>Good UI design is a plus</p>

<p>
  <b>Good artifacts design & structuring is a <u>big</u> plus</b>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<h3>Must have</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Display a single button labeled "Fetch activity" that fetches a random
    activity from the API and adds it to a list. The list starts empty. Display
    a skeleton state when a fetch is in progress. Design is up to you.
  </li>
  <li>
    The list must be automatically organized by activity category (use the
    <code>type</code> property on the fetched activity). Each activity on the
    list should display only the main title, and display additional fetched
    details when selected by the user
  </li>
  <li>
    If the same activity is randomly fetched more than once, automatically
    discard it and fetch a new one
  </li>
  <li>
    The user can mark each activity as <em>‚Äúdone‚Äù</em> by clicking on it
    (clicking again removes the mark). <em>‚Äúdone‚Äù</em> activities should be
    visually distinct from non-done ones. Design the UI accordingly
    <br />
    <br />
    <i>üîë Hint: a checkmark, a different color...</i>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="spaced-top">Would be nice to have</h3>

<ul class="orange">
  <li>
    Display a counter on the top of the page that informs the user of how many
    activities are marked as done
  </li>
  <li>
    Display activities in a grid for large displays, and in a single centered
    column for small ones.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="spaced-top">Bonus</h3>
<ul class="blue">
  <li>Using animations to transition activities state is a plus.</li>
</ul>
